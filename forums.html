          <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>As lead designer, I own the discovery, strategy, and design of the project. I am focused on using data to inform my solution in order to create the best user experience while balancing business goals. My core focus for the project was to improve the taxonomy of how the forums are structured, navigation, layout, and structure of content to improve engagement and retention.</p>

          <div class="wireframe-copy">
            <h2>Discovery</h2>
              <p>Leveraged months of research to inform the designs:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>External research was conducted to understand the competitive landscape and to extract product-specific features.</li>
                  <li>Usability tests, user surveys, and engagement data was accessed to better understand what was currently working and not working for users.</li>
                  <li>Leveraged user interview data to understand what was important to participate in the forums.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>I distilled the collective data to identify user pain points and foundational functions to create a clear benchmark for the updated directory experience.</p>
              <p><b>Key Insights</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Users have a hard time navigating the forums</li>
                  <li>Users have a hard time finding relevant content</li>
                  <li>Users have a hard time knowing where to post content</li>

          <h2>Designs</h2>
          <p>Focused on several key areas of the design to improve user engagement and meet business goals.</p>
          <p>This project is still in its early stages. As work is being done on the core infrastructure of the forums, work was started on the layout of the forums feed to increase engagement. The forum feeds layout was transitioned from a list format to a card format to allow users to see more of the post before clicking in and engaging with it. Allowing users to easily vote directly from the feed, and to trigger the users desire to hunt for more content.</p>
          <p>An A/B test was conducted to test the new design against the existing. After running for several weeks we saw the following results for the new design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Daily retention:</b> 10% increase</li>
              <li><b>Forum responses:</b> 15% increase</li>
              <li><b>Forum votes:</b> 22% increase</li>
              <li><b>Forum posts:</b> 20% increase</li>
              <li><b>Switched to old design:</b> 1%</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Based on the results we are doing a slow rollout to all users in order to monitor engagement metrics and are working on simplifying navigation for V2.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Users can now more easily engage with forum content which helps users perform some major retentive actions. Throughout the process, I was able to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, product, and development teams to bring this project to the user. As the project currently stands we continue to focus on the next major mile-stones in order to reach the desired end state.</p>
