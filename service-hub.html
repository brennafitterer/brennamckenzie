            <h2>HomeAdvisor SEO Service Hub</h2>
            <p>HomeAdvisor is always looking for new ways to connect with existing and potential users. A main focus for HomeAdvisor is connecting with users in their natural research environment through SEO efforts. In order to reach more users early on in the project lifecycle HomeAdvisor was looking to target users searching for non-intent phrases.</p>

            <div class="problem">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>HomeAdvisor used to reach users searching for non-intent home-related keywords on popular search engines and over the years rankings and engagements have declined.</p>

            <div class="goals">
              <h2>Goal</h2>
              <p>Increase SEO rankings for high level, non-intent specific home-related keywords.</p>

            <div class="solution">
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>Create new responsive web pages contect rich with non-intent home-related keywords and topics to reach users just starting to research home projects or searching for service professionals.</p>

          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As lead designer, I was charged with creating a new screen for users searching for non-intent keywords. I focused on incorporating numerous sections that had been identified to be informative for users researching home projects and that would assist in ranking and traffic for the screen. Being such a content-heavy page it was necessary to ensure an optimal layout/structure was in place to create a compelling and logical story, that the format for each section was unique yet scannable, and the placement/copy of the calls to action were easily accessible.</p>

        <div class="wireframe-section">
          <div class="wireframe-copy">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>External research was conducted to understand the competitive landscape and to extract product-specific insights. We distilled the collective data to extract key findings, user pain points, and foundational functions to create a clear benchmark for the new SEO pages.</p>
            <p>We applied the findings to the wireframes and it took several rounds of iteration with key stakeholders to distill the experience down to the core flow.</p>

          <p>Partnered with the internal design team to bring the wireframes to life.</p>
          <p>Users can easily learn more about home tasks, understand what is important when looking for a service professional, the types of questions to ask service professionals, average cost of projects, and more.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Throughout the design process, I collaborated with a number of stakeholders, product, design, and development teams to create the best experience for users searching for non-intent keywords in order to provide them with information and tools they need to convert on the HomeAdvisor site. As the design currently stands it is waiting to be developed and will be launching in early 2020.</p>
