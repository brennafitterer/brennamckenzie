            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>When creating The Event I set out to develop a mobile application where the functionalities are based on the validation of assumptions from user research. Once I was able to validate those assumptions, I designed an interface to align with the needs of our users based on user testing.</p>
            <p>If this were a real mobile application, I would continue to evolve the features and functions based on the user data I collected throughout the design process and once the application was live. Those additions would include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Making events recommendations more prevalent within the app by including them at the bottom of event pages and at the top of the popular section</li>
              <li>Add in the capability for users to add events to the app</li>
              <li>Add a social component to the app where you can follow other users, share pictures, etc.</li>
              <li>Add in location and event ratings based on past events users have attended</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I learned a lot while developing this app. Making sure to adhere to mobile guidelines, not settling for your first iteration of design and making sure your brand assets align with your target audience is key to having a successful app.</p>
