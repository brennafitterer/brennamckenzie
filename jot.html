            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Jot solves a real problem for people who are looking to save, share and write digital content. With the cloud storage and organization industry growing, I believe Jot provides a real differentiator by creating a collaborative space for users with an easy to adopt design. By creating a product that's design aligns with various email platforms it makes for easy adoption for new users creating a good user experience.</p>
            <p>In considering future development of the site, I would like to further address some of the needs requested by users to incorporate informational videos, more robust collaboration opportunities (real time) and exporting functionality.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot while developing this project. The main take away though was that data is key to the success of designing for the users and not to your assumptions. I encountered several instances where I assumed users would prefer one design and through testing, they choose the other. This project just reinforced that testing throughout the design process is how you will be able to create the most successful website and product design.</p>
