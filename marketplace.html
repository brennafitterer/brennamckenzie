          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As lead designer, I own the discovery, strategy, and design of the project. I am focused on using data to inform my solution in order to create the best user experience while balancing business goals. My core focus for the project was to improve the navigation and ux of core features to increase engagement metrics.</p>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
              <p>Leveraged three research methods to inform the designs:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>External research was conducted to understand the competitive landscape and to extract product-specific features.</li>
                  <li>Engagement data was accessed to better understand what was currently working and not working for users. Ex clicks, conversion, scroll depth, filter enagement, etc.</li>
                </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="design">
          <h2>Designs</h2>
          <p>Focused on several key areas of the design to improve user engagement and meet business goals.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Restructured the layout of the listing cards to feature relevant information for the user, made it easier to scan and compare listings, and simplified the UI to be more clean and modern.</li>
            <li>Reconfigured the search and filter features to be more prominent, always accessible, and follow a familiar design pattern.</li>
            <li>Focused on making the design responsive</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An A/B test was conducted to test the new design against the existing. After running for several weeks we saw the following results:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Listings viewed:</b> 145% increase</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Based on these results we were able to release the design to 100% and have seen a steady increase in engagement MoM.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Users can now quickly scan and engage with a number of investment opportunities to find one that is right for them. Throughout the process, I was able to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, product, and development teams to bring this project to the user.</p>
