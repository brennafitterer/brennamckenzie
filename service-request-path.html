            <h2>HomeAdvisor Service Request Path</h2>
            <p>HomeAdvisor’s core product is centered around its service request path where users are able to answer a series of questions about their home projects in order to be matched with applicable service professionals. The experience needed to be improved and given HomeAdvisor is a mobile-first product it was decided to start with improvements to the mobile web experience and iOS/Android apps first.</p>

            <div class="problem">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>The user interface for HomeAdvisor’s service request path has been appearing dated and the user experience is not up to current user standards and expectations.</p>

          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As lead designer, I was charged with improving the way users navigate through the interview path. I focused on improving the layout of the questions, navigational elements, and new vs known user experiences. I then partnered with the internal design team to elevate the look and feel of the mobile web experience as well as the iOS/Android apps.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>External research was conducted to understand the competitive landscape and to extract product-specific insights. We distilled the collective data to extract key findings, user pain points, and foundational functions to create a clear benchmark for the updated service request path.</p>
            <p>It took several rounds of iteration to distill the experience down.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Throughout the design process, I collaborated with a number of stakeholders, product, design, and development teams to create the best experience for users looking to submit a service request through the main interview path. As the design currently stands it is in development and will be launching in October 2019.</p>
