            <div class="about-copy">
              <p>Iâ€™m a digital designer with a focus on creating a great user experience and simple clean design. I enjoy being able to take data and turning it into a beautiful product custom built for the users.</p>
              <p>Throughout my career, I have always been drawn to design. The ability to turn every day things into something people can enjoy and that improves their experience has always been intriguing.</p>
              <p>I started out my career as a B2B marketer focusing on managing the development of websites, marketing collateral and events. I dabbled in design and development throughout the years but decided to take the plunge and begin the transition into a UX/UI designer in 2017.</p>
              <p>In my spare time, I enjoy taking my creativity to the dance floor. Jazz, Hip-Hop, and Lyrical have always been a passion of mine and I love that I can continue to pursue it as an adult. Outside of that, I am a true Coloradan and love to explore the outdoors with my husband and two pups.</p>
              <p>With experience working at small startups, large corporations, non-profits and freelancing, I can help you build a product your clients not only want but need. Email me today so we can get started on your project.</p>
