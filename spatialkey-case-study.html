          <section class="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>SpatialKey’s website was a bit outdated. It was not optimized for lead conversions, did not align with the current brand, did not accurately portray the solution they were selling, did not allow for marketing to easily make updates to the website and blog, and did not have a clear user flow. They were in need of a website redesign to address all of their wants and needs in order to have their website better appeal to their target audience and encourage lead conversions.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>As Marketing Manager of SpatialKey at the time, I lead the design and development of their new website. I was able to use client data and personas developed by the UX team to inform the sitemap, designed mock-ups of each of the pages, and developed design assets for the site. From there, I was able to build the website using HubSpot templates and basic CSS and HTML, conducted internal user-testing, and launched the website. Once the website was launched, I continued to maintain the website during my time there and would use data gathered to inform any edits/additions to the website.</p>
