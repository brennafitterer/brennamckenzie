            <h2>BiggerPockets Email Templates</h2>
            <p>BiggerPockets has an extensive email program that has been built for the last 10 years. As the program has grown so have the templates they have used. BiggerPockets was looking to align the UI of all email templates while trying to maintain or improve engagement metrics.</p>

          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As lead designer, I own the discovery, strategy, and design of the project. I am focused on using data to inform my solution in order to create the best user experience while balancing business goals. My core focus for the project was to improve the UI to create consistent branding within the BiggerPockets brand guidelines and increase/maintain core engagement metrics.</p>

        <div class="design">
          <h2>Designs</h2>
          <p>Focused on several key areas of the design to improve user engagement and meet business goals.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Created a consistent header, footer, and structure for the templates.</li>
            <li>Developed several reusable layouts for teams to be able to plug and play with different types of communications.</li>
            <li>Refreshed the UI to align with current brand standards. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>An A/B test was conducted to test the new design against the existing. After running for several weeks we saw the following results:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Click rate:</b> 7% increase</li>
              <li><b>Revenue:</b> 57% increase</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Based on these results we were able to release the template to more emails and have seen a steady increase in engagement MoM.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>BiggerPockets now has a reusable and consistent email template that has proved to increase engagement metrics. Throughout the process, I was able to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, product, and development teams to bring this project to the user.</p>
