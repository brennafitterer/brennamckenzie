            <h2>HomeAdvisor & Angie's List Consumer Choice Experience</h2>
            <p>HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List match users with service professionals to complete home tasks. This is done through various match types based on inputs the users provide about their projects. They were looking to improve the user experience by converting the current match experience, in which leads are auto-created on submission, to a consumer choice experience, in which leads are created only after a consumer explicitly selects a matched professional.</p>

            <div class="problem">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>Users want to be contacted by service professionals after submitting a service request, but do not want to be overwhelmed with the number of service professionals that contact them.</p>
              <p>Service professionals want to receive the highest quality leads from HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List.</p>
              <p>HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List can only improve the experience if users explicitly take action and convert with the matched service professionals.</p>

            <div class="goals">
              <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>Increase the quality of leads and provide the best possible experience for both consumers and service professionals.</p>
                <p>Increase service professionals win rate.</p>
                <p>Increase retention and LTV for service professionals.</p>
                <p>Maintain or increase revenue per service request.</p>

            <div class="solution">
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>Evolve the post submit match experience to one where the users are presented with an easily digestible list of service professionals and let them choose which professionals they would like to contact them.</p>
              <p>Create a simple and clear user flow where users can easily engage with matched service professionals and where expectations are clearly set as to what the user needs to do and what will happen once they perform the desired action.</p>

          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As a contributing designer, I was tasked with improving and redesigning the post submit user experience for the consumer choice match type. This included the experience for the results, post results, project profile, and post submit matching screens, as well as, the drip communication flow.</p>
          <p>I came into the project at a point where the base flows were already established, but the elements and interactions on each screen needed to be finessed for optimal user experience.</p>
          <h5>User flow, Wireframes (HomeAdvisor Responsive Web, App and Angie’s List Responsive Web)</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="wireframe-section">
          <div class="wireframe-copy">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>It took several rounds of iteration with key stakeholders and through user testing to distill the experience down to the core flows and screens.</p>
            <p>Key Learnings:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users indeed want to choose which professionals will contact them</li>
                <li>The majority of users want to engage with 1-3 professionals prior to selecting one for their project</li>
                <li>Users want a non-commital call-to-action in order to convert</li>
                <li>The type of project really dictates how the user wants to initially engage with a professional (call or appointment)</li>
              </ul>

          <p>Access project and service professionals details.</p>
          <h4>More Service Professionals</h4>
          <p>View and engage with additional pros that are matched to a project.</p>
          <h4>Email Communications</h4>
          <p>Users receive a series of emails providing the status of a project, service professional details, and notify when new professionals are available for a project.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Throughout the design process, I collaborated with a number of stakeholders, product, design, and development teams to create the best experience for users being matched with service professionals on HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List. As the design currently stands it has been launched in smoke markets for HomeAdvisor for the last 3 months and will be pushed to larger markets at the end of 2019. The experience is currently in development for Angie’s List and will be launching at the end of 2019. At that point, further assessment will be done to continue to improve the user experience and reach product goals.</p>
