        <p>People are looking for a variety of ways to workout and taking the workout to the home is on the rise. There are not a lot of options out there for purchasing equipment for the home, let alone responsive sites that allow you to easily search, compare, and purchase new or used equipment for all types of workouts.</p>

          <p>Dick’s Sporting Goods, has a very reputable brand making it easy for users to visit their site. Given they sell more than just workout equipment they have a robust navigation system, making it hard to find the section you are looking for. Once in the section, you have to perform multiple clicks prior to viewing products and their filtration system is not as robust.</p>

          <p>Fitness Giant has good UX/UI elements such as the way they categorize the products, search features, bread crumbs and the use of images explaining how to use the products. They could improve by simplifying the navigation, adding in filters, simplifying the UI and reducing clicks.</p>

          <p>NordicTrack has a very clean and beautiful UI, but the UX is not as user-friendly. You have to make numerous clicks to get to the product and then the product page requires quite a bit of scrolling to obtain information about the product which is not easily scalable in one area.</p>

              <li>My target audience does indeed workout and avidly. They are also potentially interested in buying workout equipment as the majority do workout at home or would be interested in it.</li>
              <li>89% of users are interested in purchasing both new and pre-owned workout equipment, which verifies my assumption and brings to light one of our core differentiators.</li>
              <li>96% of users want to be able to compare products prior to purchasing which validates my original assumption.</li>
              <li>Users are interested in purchasing a variety of types of equipment, so specializing in just conditioning equipment is not the route to go.</li>
              <li>Gathered key data to help structure my personas, structure of the site and features and functions.</li>

              <li>It felt like a streamlined process. it would be nice if there were less views to go through before purchasing</li>

            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>Once the design was in place, additional testing was required to ensure the design elements that were applied to the wireframes continued to resonate with users. To do this I conducted several preference tests to guide the direction of the design.</p><br>
            <p>My goal for the mobile view was to be able to eliminate the need for a navigation menu. I conducted user testing to ensure that including the navigation capabilities within the body of the page and pulling the search functionality out of a hamburger menu was still intuitive for users to be able to navigate and search for items within the site. The results showed that users used the navigation within the body of the site and gravitated toward the search icon over the hamburger for searching.</p><br>
