            <h2>HomeAdvisor Careers Site</h2>
            <p>As the HomeAdvisor organization continues to grow and open positions become available across all departments, it's important that the career site is a compelling reflection of the vision, mission, and culture of the company so it needed to be redesigned.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem-solution">
            <div class="problem">
              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>The company is growing and looking to attract high-quality candidates for open roles and the existing careers site does not adequately depict the companies vision, mission, and culture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="goals">
              <h2>Goal</h2>
              <p>Increase the number of applications submitted.</p>
              <p>Increase the quality of job applicants.</p>
              <p>Clearly dipict who HomeAdvisor is, what they do, why it is a great place to work, and where offices are located.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution">
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>Overhaul the career site to make it highly visual, depict core values, highlight the mission, and make the process of finding open positions and submitting an application easy and understandable.</p>

        <div class="role">
          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As lead designer who took this project over from another designer, I was charged with finalizing the new user experience by simplifying the user flow, cleaning up page structures, and establishing clear calls to action.</p>
          <h5>Research, User Flow, Wireframes, Responsive Web, Prototype</h5>

        <div class="wireframe-section">
          <div class="wireframe-copy">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>External research was conducted to understand the competitive landscape and to extract product-specific insights. We distilled the collective data to extract key findings, user pain points, and foundational functions to create a clear benchmark for the updated careers site.</p>
            <p>It took several rounds of iteration with key stakeholders to distill the experience down to the core flows and screens.</p>

          <h2>Designs</h2>
          <p>Partnered with the internal design team to bring the wireframes to life.</p>
          <p>Prospective employees can easily understand who HomeAdvisor is, what the company does, why it is a good place to work and access open positions.</p>

          <div class="conclusion-copy">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Throughout the design process, I collaborated with a number of stakeholders, product, and design teams to create the best experience for users looking to learn more about HomeAdvisor and apply to open positions. As the design currently stands it is waiting for development and plans to launch early 2020.</p>
