            <p>HomeAdvisor gives users the opportunity to research and connect with service providers through a variety of different avenues tailored to users with different research methods. The existing experience to connect with service professionals outside of the core service request path needed to be improved.</p>

          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As lead designer, I was charged with improving the way users submit a service request from a number of directory type pages. I focused on creating a simple and clear user flow, setting up clear expectations about the process, and provide additional professionals who fit the project.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>External research was conducted to understand the competitive landscape and to extract product-specific insights. We distilled the collective data to extract key findings, user pain points, and foundational functions to create a clear benchmark for the updated quick submission path.</p>
            <p>It took several rounds of iteration to distill the experience down to the core flows and screens.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Throughout the design process, I collaborated with a number of stakeholders, product, design, and development teams to create the best experience for users looking to submit a service request with HomeAdvisor directory pages. As the design currently stands it is waiting to go to design and has plans to launch early 2020.</p>
