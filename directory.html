          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>As lead designer, I owned the discovery, strategy, and design of the project. I focused on using data to inform my solution in order to create the best user experience while balancing business goals. My core focus for the project was to improve the navigation, layout, structure of content, type of content, and placement of calls to action to improve engagement and conversion within the directories.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wireframe-section">
          <div class="wireframe-copy">
            <h2>Discovery</h2>
              <p>Leveraged three research methods to inform the designs:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>External research was conducted to understand the competitive landscape and to extract product-specific features.</li>
                  <li>Engagement data was accessed to better understand what was currently working and not working for users. Ex clicks, conversions, scroll depth, filter enagement, etc.</li>
                  <li>Leveraged user interview data to understand what information was relevant to users in order to convert.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>I distilled the collective data to identify user pain points and foundational functions to create a clear benchmark for the updated directory experience.</p>
              <p><b>Key Insights</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Users want to see social validation through reviews</li>
                  <li>Users want to understand what the pro specializes in</li>
                  <li>Users want to understand what differentiates the pro</li>
                  <li>Users have trouble using the existing filters</li>
                  <li>Users do not find value in seeing stats with empty results</li>
                </ul>
          </div>

        </div>
        <div class="design">
          <h2>Designs</h2>
          <p>Focused on several key areas of the design to improve user engagement and meet business goals.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Restructured the layout of the pro cards to feature relevant information for the user, made it easier to scan and compare pros, and simplified the UI to be more clean and modern.</li>
              <li>Reconfigured the search and filter features to be more prominent, always accessible, and follow a familiar design pattern.</li>
              <li>Focused on making CTAs more prominent and incorporated a quick contact form for easy conversion and to keep users in the experience to engage with more pros.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>An A/B test was conducted to test the new design against the existing. After running for several weeks we saw the following results for the new design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Number of leads:</b> 56% increase MoM</li>
              <li><b>Cost/lead:</b> 62% increase MoM</li>
              <li><b>Profile views:</b> 56% increase MoM</li>
              <li><b>Search/filter bar:</b> 46% increase in usage MoM</li>
              <li><b>Lead distribution:</b> 53.6% non-featured and 46% featured</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Based on these results we were able to release the design to 100% and have seen a steady increase in leads MoM.</p>

          <div class="conclusion-copy">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Users can now quickly scan and engage with a number of real estate professionals to help them across a variety of real estate needs. Throughout the process, I was able to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, product, and development teams to bring this project to the user. As the design currently stands we continue to iterate to increase core engagement metrics.</p>
